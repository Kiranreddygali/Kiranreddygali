# ⚙️ Scaling Global Support Without Burnout

Scaling sounds glamorous. Global operations, round-the-clock service, impact metrics. But behind every dashboard spike is a team that might be running on fumes.

When Tronox’s footprint expanded across regions, our support services followed suit. But rather than throwing headcount at volume, we chose something better—design.

## 🌍 Challenges We Faced
- Different SLAs across geographies  
- Varied team maturity levels  
- Legacy systems with patchy documentation

A lesser-known hurdle: silent burnout. People didn’t say it, but engagement dipped, creative thinking faded, and escalations went unflagged.

So we:
- Rotated leadership roles across quarters to spark fresh energy  
- Automated repetitive ticket flows with AI bots  
- Built a dashboard that showed not just KPIs, but feedback loops

One Ops lead told me, “It’s the first time I’ve felt seen before metrics.” That stuck.

## 🔧 Takeaways
- Automation handles volume—leaders handle velocity  
- Visualization empowers self-correction  
- Sustainability isn’t a checkbox—it’s culture by design

Scaling isn’t about doing more. It’s about enabling better.
