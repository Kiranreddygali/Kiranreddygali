# 🚪 Lessons from Maintaining 0% Attrition

Ask anyone in operations: attrition is inevitable. Or is it?

While leading Tronox’s India Support Center, we hit a milestone many consider unrealistic—0% voluntary attrition over multiple years. And no, we didn’t achieve that with beanbags and pizza Fridays.

It started with intent. We built systems that respected people as creators of service, not passengers in process.

## 🧠 Small Actions, Big Impact
- Every new hire got a welcome note from me—not HR automation  
- Career paths were visible and encouraged during quarterly retrospectives  
- Leaders were trained to ask “How are you?” before “Where’s the ticket?”

One moment that stuck with me: A junior analyst asked if she could shadow patch cycles to learn. The old playbook said “not your role.” Ours said “let’s make space.” Two quarters later, she was a certified lead on that cycle.

## 🔍 Lessons Learned
- Psychological safety drives performance  
- Purpose outlasts pressure  
- Attrition isn’t fought with perks—it’s prevented with belonging

Culture isn’t a banner—it’s built in quiet moments and brave conversations.
