# 🙌 Servant Leadership in Tech Environments

In the pressure-cooker world of IT service delivery, it’s tempting to lead with authority and process. But the real breakthroughs happen when leaders start serving—not just directing—their teams.

During my time scaling support services at Tronox, I inherited a team stretched thin across time zones, legacy systems, and high expectations. My first instinct? Simplify process. My better instinct? Listen deeply.

One engineer shared how he hadn’t been asked about career goals in years. Another admitted they stayed late not for work, but to avoid the “what did you finish?” pressure next morning. I realized: metrics follow morale.

So we built systems where:
- One-on-ones were safe zones for growth, not task reviews  
- Recognition was public, but coaching was private  
- Everyone understood why their work mattered—not just how it fit

## 💡 Real Impact:
- Tickets closed faster when staff felt respected  
- Ideas flowed from all levels, not just top-down  
- Our CSAT improved because employee empathy translated to user empathy

Servant leadership isn’t soft—it’s scalable. In tech, it’s often the difference between surviving and thriving.
